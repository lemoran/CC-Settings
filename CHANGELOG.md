### Added
- `skillOverrides` setting (Default / Name Only / User-Invocable Only / Off) in General → Language & Output
- `prUrlTemplate` setting in General → Attribution for custom PR-badge URLs
- `alwaysLoad` toggle on the MCP server editor — bypasses tool-search deferral for that server
- New environment variables in the Environment view:
  - Display: `CLAUDE_CODE_HIDE_CWD`, `CLAUDE_CODE_FORCE_SYNC_OUTPUT`
  - Updates section (new): `DISABLE_UPDATES`, `CLAUDE_CODE_PACKAGE_MANAGER_AUTO_UPDATE`

  - Bedrock section (new): `ANTHROPIC_BEDROCK_SERVICE_TIER`

### Fixed

### Added
- Opus 4.7 and Opus 4.7 (1M context) in the model picker
